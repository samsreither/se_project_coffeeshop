# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is a good sample website to use for a small business like a restaurant or coffee shop. In this case, this page was designed for "Triple Peaks Coffee Shop" using HTML and CSS.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## How I Would Improve the Project

- Add a to-go form to order coffee to takeaway. User can select the time they want it to be ready, and pay online. All user does is come in the shop and pick it up.
